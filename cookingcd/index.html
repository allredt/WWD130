                <h2>What is Celiac Disease?</h2>
                <p>Celiac Disease is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes damage to the lining (villi) of the small intestine after the consumption of gluten. 
                    Essentially, a personâ€™s immune system sees gluten as a threat but ends up attacking the villi in the intestines which help digest food.  
                    Leaving this disease undiagnosed can cause lifelong digestive problems and possible malnutrition. It is estimated that 1 in 100 people have celiac disease. 
                    Currently there is only one treatment for celiac disease, lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet.

                <h2>Symptoms</h2>
                <p>Symptoms of celiac disease can vary greatly between people. 
                    Some may experience everything from digestive issues to symptoms that are not related to the digestive system including headaches, 
                    joint pain, anemia, and rashes. Furthermore, some people with celiac disease may not have any symptoms at all. 
                    This makes Celiac Disease particularly tricky to diagnose, and for those with extreme symptoms, it can be quite painful to live with.</p>
