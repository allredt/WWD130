                <ul>
                    <li>What is the difference between Celiac Disease and Gluten Intolerance or gluten sensitivity?</li>
                    <li>People who have gluten intolerance or sensitivity may experience the same symptoms of celiac disease such as gastrointestinal distress, however they will not have damage to the villi of the small intestines.</li>
                    <li>Can a person with Celiac Disease consume small portions of gluten without experiencing symptoms?</li>
                    <li>Yes, some people with Celiac Disease have no symptoms at all after consuming gluten. However, despite not having symptoms, the immune reaction will still cause damage to the lining of their small intestine.</li>
                    <li>How much gluten is safe for a person with celiac disease to have?</li>
                    <li>Optimally people with Celiac Disease should not have any gluten, however this is almost impossible to maintain. Best practice for gluten consumption for those with Celiac Disease are foods that contain no more than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten with a maximum of 10 milligrams of gluten a day. To give a comparison, 1 breadcrumb contains 24-30 mg of gluten which is 3 times the amount of gluten a person with Celiac Disease is safe consuming in a day. So essentially, they can have 1/3rd of a wheat breadcrumb a day. Keep in mind that some people with Celiac Disease may react to trace levels as little as 1/60th of a breadcrumb per day so keeping gluten as minimal as possible is essential.</li>
                    <li>Is Celiac Disease Genetic?</li>
                    <li>Yes, Celiac Disease is hereditary, so if you were diagnosed with Celiac Disease, your family should also be tested for Celiac Disease. This being said, some people with Celiac Disease may not have any hereditary indicators.</li>
                    <li>If I have celiac disease and choose not to follow a gluten free diet, what long term complications can this result in?</li>
                    <li>Leaving Celiac Disease untreated can lead to malnutrition, early onset osteoporosis, liver failure, neurological symptoms, pancreatic insufficiency, anemia, intestinal cancers, and many other complications including a drastic increase in the chance of developing another autoimmune disorder. </li>
                    <li>Are people with Celiac Disease born with it?</li>
                    <li>No, People with celiac disease are not born with the disease active in bodies, however they are born with the genetic predisposition to develop it due to the HLA-DQ2 and/or DQ8 genotypes they carry. Triggering Celiac Disease can happen at any age by consuming the gluten protein, however we currently do not know what other factors may influence the triggering of this Disease.</li>
                    <li>How long will symptoms last after accidentally eating gluten?</li>
                    <li>For people with Celiac Disease, the length of symptoms may vary, with some people having no symptoms at all and some lasting for weeks to months with digestive difficulties after an accidental gluten consumption. </li>
