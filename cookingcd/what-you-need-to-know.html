                <h3>Reading Food Labels</h3>
                <p>A common misconception regarding foods containing gluten is the idea to just to eliminate wheat. 
                    While this is the most common carrier of gluten, it can also be found in various derivates of 
                    wheat such as spelt, graham, semolina, durum, etc. as well as barley, rye, malt, brewer’s yeast, 
                    triticale, and wheat starch. These ingredients can often be hidden in food labels, so it is 
                    important to know what to look for if you plan to cook foods for someone with Celiac Disease.
                </p>
                <h4>Tips and Tricks</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Look for the gluten free certified seal from the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (<a href="https://gfco.org/">GFCO.org</a>) on the products packaging.</li>
                    <li>Check the allergen list at the bottom of the ingredients. Any foods containing wheat can automatically be eliminated from your list of ingredients.</li>
                    <li>While wheat is required to be on allergen lists, be sure to thoroughly read through labels that do not list wheat as wheat is NOT the only ingredient that gluten can come from.</li>
                    <li>Look for common “aka’s” such as malt aka barley, breadcrumbs aka wheat, starch/dextrin aka wheat starch (can also be derived from corn, but if not stated on the label, better to be safe than sorry) multigrain/artisan/natural flavors aka unspecified ingredients may contain gluten.</li>
                    <li>Be careful of oats and popcorn. While these two foods are gluten free, the machinery used to harvest them is often used to also harvest wheat which can lead to cross contamination.</li>
                    <li>Check spice ingredients natural flavors and vague ingredients may contain gluten.</li>
                    <li>Avoid using shared condiments or foods where double dipping may have occurred leading to cross contamination.</li>
                    <li>Avoid food from bakeries or pizzerias that are not certified gluten-free.</li>
                    <li>If you aren’t sure, ask the person with Celiac Disease if it is a safe product or avoid it.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Cross Contamination</h3>
                <h4>What is "Glutened"?</h4>
                <p>This is a common term used around our house that means accidentally contaminating a piece of food that was gluten free with gluten or accidentally consuming a piece of food that contained gluten. </p>
                <p>Now that you have your ingredients, let’s get to the nitty gritty of Celiac Disease and making food. 
                    The biggest concern at this point is cross contamination. We commonly avoid cross contamination with 
                    items such as raw meats and vegetables to ensure they do not encounter each other thus preventing us 
                    from getting sick. Think of this the same way for a person with Celiac Disease. If you have used a 
                    knife to spread mayonnaise on a piece of normal gluten bread and then without washing the knife, used 
                    it to spread mayonnaise on a piece of gluten free bread, you have just contaminated, or “glutened”, 
                    not only the gluten free bread you spread the mayonnaise on, but also the entire jar of mayonnaise, 
                    making it a potential disaster for a person with celiac disease to eat it on sandwiches in the future.</p>
                <p>It is extremely important when cooking for people with Celiac Disease to ensure that all items that the food 
                    will touch are freshly washed to ensure minimal potential contact with gluten. While this is easy to do 
                    with non-porous surfaces such as knives, glasses, counter tops, etc, this can be considerably more difficult
                    with porous surface items such as cutting boards, plastic plates, or cups, etc. Some great alternatives to
                    these would be using disposable items such as paper plates, single use utensils, disposable foil pans, etc. 
                    This can help eliminate contamination that may be embedded in these items. Additionally, at times, the 
                    appliances used by someone who cooks with gluten can contaminate a person with celiac disease. 
                    Think of the fans or setup in a microwave, toaster, or air frier and how these would be impossible to clean 
                    all the gluten out of that could have been stuck in them. Friers should also be avoided as previous gluten 
                    food fried in the oil will have contaminated the oil. The best method of cooking with appliances for celiac
                    disease is to use solid metals stove top pans, avoid nonstick or cast-iron pans as gluten can get embedded
                    in these and will not come out despite washing. Wheat flour can stay air born for many hours, so be sure
                    you clean your counters thoroughly, let them sit for several hours, and re-clean them prior to making 
                    gluten free food. If you need to use an oven, it is best practice to clean the oven and let it sit for 
                    at least 24 hours prior to using it to cook gluten free foods to avoid cross contamination.</p>
